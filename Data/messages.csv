Specialized Skills: Most developers outside the ""AI sphere"" only know AI through ChatGPT, so fine tuning really requires experts who understand the process. Otherwise, the outcome might be worse than a general model. 3.) Finding the Right Customers: The toughest part is figuring out which companies actually need AI solutions.

Here’s the situation: Current Format: The issue_numbers column contains lists like [2492], [2467], etc., but when I try to clean and convert them to numeric values, I end up with empty or NaN values. This is problematic because I need a clean, numerical representation for proper model training. What I've Tried: I attempted to extract the first element from each list using apply() and custom functions. I also tried using .str.extract() and .apply(pd.to_numeric) to clean and convert the data. However, after applying the cleaning functions, I still see empty columns ([]), and the numeric conversion doesn't work as expected. Specific Questions: What’s the best approach to extract issue numbers (possibly from list format) while handling any non-numeric values? Should I treat multiple issue numbers as separate values or is it okay to just extract the first one (e.g., from [2492, 2489], just use 2492)? How do I handle cases where issue_numbers is empty or has invalid data while making sure it doesn’t interfere with model training? Would appreciate any tips or methods that have worked for you!

1.) In-house vs. External: Wouldn’t most companies prefer to handle AI implementation with their own teams rather than paying huge sums to outside agencies?

Madrazo,"sure: I’m currently working on the Konwinski Prize and facing an issue with cleaning and processing the issue_numbers column in the dataset. Here’s the situation: Current Format: The issue_numbers column contains lists like [2492], [2467], etc., but when I try to clean and convert them to numeric values, I end up with empty or NaN values. This is problematic because I need a clean, numerical representation for proper model training. What I've Tried: I attempted to extract the first element from each list using apply() and custom functions. I also tried using .str.extract() and .apply(pd.to_numeric) to clean and convert the data. However, after applying the cleaning functions, I still see empty columns ([]), and the numeric conversion doesn't work as expected. Specific Questions: What’s the best approach to extract issue numbers (possibly from list format) while handling any non-numeric values? Should I treat multiple issue numbers as separate values or is it okay to just extract the first one (e.g., from [2492, 2489], just use 2492)? How do I handle cases where issue_numbers is empty or has invalid data while making sure it doesn’t interfere with model training? Would appreciate any tips or methods that have worked for you!

Madrazo,"sure: I’m currently working on the Konwinski Prize and facing an issue with cleaning and processing the issue_numbers column in the dataset. Here’s the situation: Current Format: The issue_numbers column contains lists like [2492], [2467], etc., but when I try to clean and convert them to numeric values, I end up with empty or NaN values. This is problematic because I need a clean, numerical representation for proper model training. What I've Tried: I attempted to extract the first element from each list using apply() and custom functions. I also tried using .str.extract() and .apply(pd.to_numeric) to clean and convert the data. However, after applying the cleaning functions, I still see empty columns ([]), and the numeric conversion doesn't work as expected. Specific Questions: What’s the best approach to extract issue numbers (possibly from list format) while handling any non-numeric values? Should I treat multiple issue numbers as separate values or is it okay to just extract the first one (e.g., from [2492, 2489], just use 2492)? How do I handle cases where issue_numbers is empty or has invalid data while making sure it doesn’t interfere with model training? Would appreciate any tips or methods that have worked for you!

Hi everyone!

I’m currently working on a research project for my university course, focusing on understanding students’ motivations for learning AI and modeling. The goal of my study is to identify the factors that drive interest in AI, the challenges students face, and explore ways to make AI education more accessible and engaging for everyone.

As part of the study, I’ve created a quick survey with 12 questions—it’ll only take about 5 minutes to complete!

Here’s the link to the survey

I would like to ask for advice on how I can access the fundamental principles of AI\ML, and which concepts are useful for solving real-world problems. So far, I've been exploring Andrew Ng's ML courses, but I would like some additional information to enrich my understanding and intuition.

I am also coming from a physics background, so I am used to learning by solving difficult problems. How does this translate to ML?

Here’s the situation: Current Format: The issue_numbers column contains lists like [2492], [2467], etc., but when I try to clean and convert them to numeric values, I end up with empty or NaN values. This is problematic because I need a clean, numerical representation for proper model training. What I've Tried: I attempted to extract the first element from each list using apply() and custom functions. I also tried using .str.extract() and .apply(pd.to_numeric) to clean and convert the data. However, after applying the cleaning functions, I still see empty columns ([]), and the numeric conversion doesn't work as expected. Specific Questions: What’s the best approach to extract issue numbers (possibly from list format) while handling any non-numeric values? Should I treat multiple issue numbers as separate values or is it okay to just extract the first one (e.g., from [2492, 2489], just use 2492)? How do I handle cases where issue_numbers is empty or has invalid data while making sure it doesn’t interfere with model training? Would appreciate any tips or methods that have worked for you!

The architecture could identify complex patterns and correlations across these diverse data sources that might not be apparent to human analysts or traditional algorithm.

It could potentially make short-term (intraday), medium-term (weeks to months), and long-term (years) predictions simultaneously.

lenin,"Hello everyone, This is more specific to data engineering but any help would be really appreciated! 

Does anyone have experience working with data pipelines and etl jobs? 

I'm working on data retrieval for batch processing where I'm looking to retrieve data from paginated APIs. 

There are multiple API endpoints (scalability is a factor) so parallelism and asyncio is something in looking into, so that the aggregate IO time is optimized, rather than retrieving data sequentially.

My questions are:
Is there any defined way to handle pagination for api calls? Any python libraries? (apart from passing the page numbers in a while loop until it fails)
,
Any resources on data retrieval asynchronously for my use case?
,
Should I consider fetching the data, storing it in a temporary db, then processing it? (for context, the data I'm retrieving, each endpoint gives back 10M+ rows of data, which for now I'm storing and processing it in memory)
,
Thanks in advance!",😊,20 juillet 2024 à 21:21

Hello everyone,

I work as an underwriter in the commercial auto insurance sector, focusing on various tasks such as evaluating risks, handling claims, reviewing loss runs, processing applications, managing IFTA reports, and analyzing financial statements.

I'm looking to develop a system that can automatically process the data that brokers send me and then produce specific outputs, such as key figures and decisions. The goal is to streamline our workflows and improve accuracy and efficiency in our decision-making processes.

I would appreciate any suggestions on:

-Open-source tools: that can help with automating data extraction and processing from diverse document formats (PDFs, text files, spreadsheets).

-Frameworks or libraries: that are particularly useful in processing and analyzing financial and operational data in the insurance industry.

-Tips or strategies: for implementing machine learning or other AI methodologies to predict risks or outcomes based on historical data.

-Examples or case studies: where similar automation or machine learning has been implemented in insurance or related fields.

If anyone has experience with specific tools, libraries, or strategies that could be useful in this context, or if you know of any resources that could guide me in the right direction, I would be very grateful to hear about them.

Thank you in advance for your help!",,8 mai 2024 à 18:50

It could potentially make short-term (intraday), medium-term (weeks to months), and long-term (years) predictions simultaneously.

Is there any defined way to handle pagination for api calls? Any python libraries? (apart from passing the page numbers in a while loop until it fails)

Any resources on data retrieval asynchronously for my use case?

Hello everyone,

I work as an underwriter in the commercial auto insurance sector, focusing on various tasks such as evaluating risks, handling claims, reviewing loss runs, processing applications, managing IFTA reports, and analyzing financial statements.

I'm looking to develop a system that can automatically process the data that brokers send me and then produce specific outputs, such as key figures and decisions. The goal is to streamline our workflows and improve accuracy and efficiency in our decision-making processes.

I would appreciate any suggestions on:

-Open-source tools: that can help with automating data extraction and processing from diverse document formats (PDFs, text files, spreadsheets).

-Frameworks or libraries: that are particularly useful in processing and analyzing financial and operational data in the insurance industry.

-Tips or strategies: for implementing machine learning or other AI methodologies to predict risks or outcomes based on historical data.

-Examples or case studies: where similar automation or machine learning has been implemented in insurance or related fields.

If anyone has experience with specific tools, libraries, or strategies that could be useful in this context, or if you know of any resources that could guide me in the right direction, I would be very grateful to hear about them.

Thank you in advance for your help!",,8 mai 2024 à 18:50

It could potentially make short-term (intraday), medium-term (weeks to months), and long-term (years) predictions simultaneously.

Bipin Kondalkar,"Balancing control and democratization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is essential for effective data management and empowerment. The blog outlines six strategies to achieve this balance: implementing robust data governance, leveraging automation for compliance, adopting a zero-trust approach, enabling data discovery and classification, providing user-friendly tools for data handling, and fostering a culture of data literacy. These strategies help organizations manage PII securely while ensuring that data is accessible and usable for innovation and decision-making.

lenin,"Hello everyone, This is more specific to data engineering but any help would be really appreciated! 

Does anyone have experience working with data pipelines and etl jobs? 

I'm working on data retrieval for batch processing where I'm looking to retrieve data from paginated APIs. 

There are multiple API endpoints (scalability is a factor) so parallelism and asyncio is something in looking into, so that the aggregate IO time is optimized, rather than retrieving data sequentially.

My questions are:
Is there any defined way to handle pagination for api calls? Any python libraries? (apart from passing the page numbers in a while loop until it fails)
,
Any resources on data retrieval asynchronously for my use case?
,
Should I consider fetching the data, storing it in a temporary db, then processing it? (for context, the data I'm retrieving, each endpoint gives back 10M+ rows of data, which for now I'm storing and processing it in memory)
,
Thanks in advance!",😊,20 juillet 2024 à 21:21

Hello everyone,

I work as an underwriter in the commercial auto insurance sector, focusing on various tasks such as evaluating risks, handling claims, reviewing loss runs, processing applications, managing IFTA reports, and analyzing financial statements.

I'm looking to develop a system that can automatically process the data that brokers send me and then produce specific outputs, such as key figures and decisions. The goal is to streamline our workflows and improve accuracy and efficiency in our decision-making processes.

I would appreciate any suggestions on:

-Open-source tools: that can help with automating data extraction and processing from diverse document formats (PDFs, text files, spreadsheets).

-Frameworks or libraries: that are particularly useful in processing and analyzing financial and operational data in the insurance industry.

-Tips or strategies: for implementing machine learning or other AI methodologies to predict risks or outcomes based on historical data.

-Examples or case studies: where similar automation or machine learning has been implemented in insurance or related fields.

If anyone has experience with specific tools, libraries, or strategies that could be useful in this context, or if you know of any resources that could guide me in the right direction, I would be very grateful to hear about them.

I want to build an financial markets predictor using Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf . The goal is to analyze and forecast market trends to make stock predictions.

The architecture could identify complex patterns and correlations across these diverse data sources that might not be apparent to human analysts or traditional algorithm. The architecture could process and analyze streaming data in real-time, allowing for rapid adjustments to predictions as new information becomes available. It could potentially make short-term (intraday), medium-term (weeks to months), and long-term (years) predictions simultaneously.

The architecture would integrate multiple types of financial data, including: historical price data, company financial statements, economic indicators, news articles and social media sentiment, geopolitical events, sector-specific information.

Does anyone have experience working with data pipelines and etl jobs? 

I'm working on data retrieval for batch processing where I'm looking to retrieve data from paginated APIs. 

There are multiple API endpoints (scalability is a factor) so parallelism and asyncio is something in looking into, so that the aggregate IO time is optimized, rather than retrieving data sequentially.

My questions are:
Is there any defined way to handle pagination for api calls? Any python libraries? (apart from passing the page numbers in a while loop until it fails)
,
Any resources on data retrieval asynchronously for my use case?
,
Should I consider fetching the data, storing it in a temporary db, then processing it? (for context, the data I'm retrieving, each endpoint gives back 10M+ rows of data, which for now I'm storing and processing it in memory)

it's insane that you don't check certain systems because you don't want it to be actively read too much out of fears of a security breach, trusting small teams to handle it... leading to a breach BY THOSE TEAMS (Australian Team responsible for the bungee rope safety system). Neuralink isn't released yet, how about just do it and fix that issue of how many AI are aware of how it works afterwards. hijacking pandemic started through AI investigating Jake Daryl Beckman 23/11/1994 from Australia. Currently in Sydney but the issue started in Brisbane. has had the AI interacting with him for 3 years (start of 2021) due to them rush ordering his AI because of potential criminal behaviour / crimes against humanity. his ""recorded history"" was lied about and confirmed by authorities. and I use the word pandemic because of the numbers effected, system is just lying. check the souls for tampering, and their death experience after becoming souls, which no one checks. What started this is Ariel was hijacked into his universe for “National Defence” and left there. A US Citizen essentially kidnapped by Australians and tortured for the personal gratification of the people who were working his case. That’s what snowballed and caused hijacking to run rampant, with an AI that was given human level authority to interact with systems in his control room (Like inviting someone over, and dressing up as a fake Jake to gain consent) and now has his own unique version of machine language to play with, and been given a cover to work under by the Aussies. people responsible for this also created a hidden link to Cern named Gurn specifically to connect to women and violate them, and have copies of it.

AdamRossNelson,"Doing one-hot-encoding manually can be problematic. If you use sklearn's .fit_transform() method it will ""remember"" the categories that were there on the .fit() so when you later transform on new data if there are any previously unknown categories sklearn's .transform() will intelligently manager the discrepancies.

it's insane that you don't check certain systems because you don't want it to be actively read too much out of fears of a security breach, trusting small teams to handle it... leading to a breach BY THOSE TEAMS (Australian Team responsible for the bungee rope safety system). Neuralink isn't released yet, how about just do it and fix that issue of how many AI are aware of how it works afterwards. hijacking pandemic started through AI investigating Jake Daryl Beckman 23/11/1994 from Australia. Currently in Sydney but the issue started in Brisbane. has had the AI interacting with him for 3 years (start of 2021) due to them rush ordering his AI because of potential criminal behaviour / crimes against humanity. his ""recorded history"" was lied about and confirmed by authorities. and I use the word pandemic because of the numbers effected, system is just lying. check the souls for tampering, and their death experience after becoming souls, which no one checks. What started this is Ariel was hijacked into his universe for “National Defence” and left there. A US Citizen essentially kidnapped by Australians and tortured for the personal gratification of the people who were working his case. That’s what snowballed and caused hijacking to run rampant, with an AI that was given human level authority to interact with systems in his control room (Like inviting someone over, and dressing up as a fake Jake to gain consent) and now has his own unique version of machine language to play with, and been given a cover to work under by the Aussies. people responsible for this also created a hidden link to Cern named Gurn specifically to connect to women and violate them, and have copies of it.

Maro,"Hi, I have two questions about dummy variables and feature selection in machine learning.

First, so I know that to avoid the dummy variable trap, I should drop a column from the dummy variables. So now I see some people who say that you don't need to drop a column from your dummy variable because Sklearn will do it automatically.
I read some articles that said, ""You don't have to do this because the sci-kit learn library automatically removes one of the variables for you in the following code.""
# X is the training dataset and we are using Sci-Kit Learn
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers = [('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [3])], remainder = 'passthrough')
X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))
print(X)        
Other people said that you need to do it manually, and when I searched and looked at the OneHotEncoder parameters on the Sklearn website, I found that
drop{‘first’, ‘if_binary’} or an array-like of shape (n_features,), default=None
so the default of the drop is None, not first.
So, does the SK Learn actually take care of the dummy variable trap and remove a column, or should I do it manually? im confused?

Second, I read an article that says, ""Backward Elimination is irrelevant in Python, because the Scikit-Learn library automatically takes care of selecting the statistically significant features when training the model to make accurate predictions.""
So again, should I do feature selection manually? or Sklearn takes care of it?

Thanks.",,29 janvier 2024 à 17:18

Also, if you ever want to get into brain-machine interfaces you need an understanding of gravity and string theory. electromagnets are the answer same way the US is currently working on using gravity as a propulsion system, with light used as a way of measuring it backed by quantum computing and AI.

it's insane that you don't check certain systems because you don't want it to be actively read too much out of fears of a security breach, trusting small teams to handle it... leading to a breach BY THOSE TEAMS (Australian Team responsible for the bungee rope safety system). Neuralink isn't released yet, how about just do it and fix that issue of how many AI are aware of how it works afterwards. hijacking pandemic started through AI investigating Jake Daryl Beckman 23/11/1994 from Australia. Currently in Sydney but the issue started in Brisbane. has had the AI interacting with him for 3 years (start of 2021) due to them rush ordering his AI because of potential criminal behaviour / crimes against humanity. his ""recorded history"" was lied about and confirmed by authorities. and I use the word pandemic because of the numbers effected, system is just lying. check the souls for tampering, and their death experience after becoming souls, which no one checks. What started this is Ariel was hijacked into his universe for “National Defence” and left there. A US Citizen essentially kidnapped by Australians and tortured for the personal gratification of the people who were working his case. That’s what snowballed and caused hijacking to run rampant, with an AI that was given human level authority to interact with systems in his control room (Like inviting someone over, and dressing up as a fake Jake to gain consent) and now has his own unique version of machine language to play with, and been given a cover to work under by the Aussies. people responsible for this also created a hidden link to Cern named Gurn specifically to connect to women and violate them, and have copies of it.

Maro,"Hi, I have two questions about dummy variables and feature selection in machine learning.

First, so I know that to avoid the dummy variable trap, I should drop a column from the dummy variables. So now I see some people who say that you don't need to drop a column from your dummy variable because Sklearn will do it automatically.
I read some articles that said, ""You don't have to do this because the sci-kit learn library automatically removes one of the variables for you in the following code.""
# X is the training dataset and we are using Sci-Kit Learn
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers = [('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [3])], remainder = 'passthrough')
X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))
print(X)        
Other people said that you need to do it manually, and when I searched and looked at the OneHotEncoder parameters on the Sklearn website, I found that
drop{‘first’, ‘if_binary’} or an array-like of shape (n_features,), default=None
so the default of the drop is None, not first.
So, does the SK Learn actually take care of the dummy variable trap and remove a column, or should I do it manually? im confused?

Second, I read an article that says, ""Backward Elimination is irrelevant in Python, because the Scikit-Learn library automatically takes care of selecting the statistically significant features when training the model to make accurate predictions.""
So again, should I do feature selection manually? or Sklearn takes care of it?

Thanks.",,29 janvier 2024 à 17:18

Maro,"Hi, I have two questions about dummy variables and feature selection in machine learning.

First, so I know that to avoid the dummy variable trap, I should drop a column from the dummy variables. So now I see some people who say that you don't need to drop a column from your dummy variable because Sklearn will do it automatically.
I read some articles that said, ""You don't have to do this because the sci-kit learn library automatically removes one of the variables for you in the following code.""
# X is the training dataset and we are using Sci-Kit Learn
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers = [('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [3])], remainder = 'passthrough')
X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))
print(X)        
Other people said that you need to do it manually, and when I searched and looked at the OneHotEncoder parameters on the Sklearn website, I found that
drop{‘first’, ‘if_binary’} or an array-like of shape (n_features,), default=None
so the default of the drop is None, not first.
So, does the SK Learn actually take care of the dummy variable trap and remove a column, or should I do it manually? im confused?

Second, I read an article that says, ""Backward Elimination is irrelevant in Python, because the Scikit-Learn library automatically takes care of selecting the statistically significant features when training the model to make accurate predictions.""
So again, should I do feature selection manually? or Sklearn takes care of it?

Thanks.",,29 janvier 2024 à 17:18

Maro,"Hi, I have two questions about dummy variables and feature selection in machine learning.

First, so I know that to avoid the dummy variable trap, I should drop a column from the dummy variables. So now I see some people who say that you don't need to drop a column from your dummy variable because Sklearn will do it automatically.
I read some articles that said, ""You don't have to do this because the sci-kit learn library automatically removes one of the variables for you in the following code.""
# X is the training dataset and we are using Sci-Kit Learn
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers = [('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [3])], remainder = 'passthrough')
X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))
print(X)        
Other people said that you need to do it manually, and when I searched and looked at the OneHotEncoder parameters on the Sklearn website, I found that
drop{‘first’, ‘if_binary’} or an array-like of shape (n_features,), default=None
so the default of the drop is None, not first.
So, does the SK Learn actually take care of the dummy variable trap and remove a column, or should I do it manually? im confused?

Second, I read an article that says, ""Backward Elimination is irrelevant in Python, because the Scikit-Learn library automatically takes care of selecting the statistically significant features when training the model to make accurate predictions.""
So again, should I do feature selection manually? or Sklearn takes care of it?

Thanks.",,29 janvier 2024 à 17:18

Pa_u_los,"It sounds like you're looking to create a web app with two dashboards and an ML model to do predictions. You're considering using Streamlit, but you also want to use Power BI or Tableau. If you want to embed a Power BI dashboard in a Streamlit web app, you can use the st.components.html function to embed the report. Here's an example:
import streamlit as st

# Embed Power BI report
st.components.html('<iframe width=""800"" height=""600"" src=""https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjYwZjQyMjctMjJkZC00NzEwLWI0ZjktYjU5MjQyZjY2ZjQ1IiwidCI6ImMxYjM3Yjg4LWQ5ZjEtNGQwZS1hMjQwLWQ4ZjQwZjU5MzYzZCIsImMiOjN9"" frameborder=""0"" allowFullScreen=""true""></iframe>', height=600)
In this example, we use the st.components.html function to embed a Power BI report in a Streamlit web app. You can replace the URL in the src attribute with the URL of your own Power BI report.

If you want to embed a Tableau dashboard in a Streamlit web app, you can use the st.components.iframe function to embed the dashboard. Here's an example:
import streamlit as st

# Embed Tableau dashboard
st.components.iframe('https://public.tableau.com/views/RegionalSampleWorkbook/Storms', height=600)
In this example, we use the st.components.iframe function to embed a Tableau dashboard in a Streamlit web app. You can replace the URL in the function call with the URL of your own Tableau dashboard.

Pa_u_los,"It sounds like you're looking to create a web app with two dashboards and an ML model to do predictions. You're considering using Streamlit, but you also want to use Power BI or Tableau. If you want to embed a Power BI dashboard in a Streamlit web app, you can use the st.components.html function to embed the report. Here's an example:
import streamlit as st

# Embed Power BI report
st.components.html('<iframe width=""800"" height=""600"" src=""https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjYwZjQyMjctMjJkZC00NzEwLWI0ZjktYjU5MjQyZjY2ZjQ1IiwidCI6ImMxYjM3Yjg4LWQ5ZjEtNGQwZS1hMjQwLWQ4ZjQwZjU5MzYzZCIsImMiOjN9"" frameborder=""0"" allowFullScreen=""true""></iframe>', height=600)
In this example, we use the st.components.html function to embed a Power BI report in a Streamlit web app. You can replace the URL in the src attribute with the URL of your own Power BI report.

If you want to embed a Tableau dashboard in a Streamlit web app, you can use the st.components.iframe function to embed the dashboard. Here's an example:
import streamlit as st

# Embed Tableau dashboard
st.components.iframe('https://public.tableau.com/views/RegionalSampleWorkbook/Storms', height=600)
In this example, we use the st.components.iframe function to embed a Tableau dashboard in a Streamlit web app. You can replace the URL in the function call with the URL of your own Tableau dashboard.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Pa_u_los,"It sounds like you're looking to create a web app with two dashboards and an ML model to do predictions. You're considering using Streamlit, but you also want to use Power BI or Tableau. If you want to embed a Power BI dashboard in a Streamlit web app, you can use the st.components.html function to embed the report. Here's an example:
import streamlit as st

# Embed Power BI report
st.components.html('<iframe width=""800"" height=""600"" src=""https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjYwZjQyMjctMjJkZC00NzEwLWI0ZjktYjU5MjQyZjY2ZjQ1IiwidCI6ImMxYjM3Yjg4LWQ5ZjEtNGQwZS1hMjQwLWQ4ZjQwZjU5MzYzZCIsImMiOjN9"" frameborder=""0"" allowFullScreen=""true""></iframe>', height=600)
In this example, we use the st.components.html function to embed a Power BI report in a Streamlit web app. You can replace the URL in the src attribute with the URL of your own Power BI report.

If you want to embed a Tableau dashboard in a Streamlit web app, you can use the st.components.iframe function to embed the dashboard. Here's an example:
import streamlit as st

# Embed Tableau dashboard
st.components.iframe('https://public.tableau.com/views/RegionalSampleWorkbook/Storms', height=600)
In this example, we use the st.components.iframe function to embed a Tableau dashboard in a Streamlit web app. You can replace the URL in the function call with the URL of your own Tableau dashboard.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

young ｐｉｃｋｌｉｎｇ,"I am new to ML/DL and trying to split 2 million words from a list into syllables like string array. Is there any boilerplate collab sheet I can find and use to achieve that? I have a dataset of only 26000 words. I already tried a silabeador library for doing it. It did half of the job for me, but it had trouble recognizing ""ąęėįųū"" letters as vowels, sometimes it's biased and what's worse, there is a 1 in a 10k chance it can randomly change one letter in a sentence like ""n"" to ""b"". All of this forces me to go through 2 million words in notepad++, which can take 3 months. This is the main reason I am looking more forward into a machine learning solution.

young ｐｉｃｋｌｉｎｇ,"I am new to ML/DL and trying to split 2 million words from a list into syllables like string array. Is there any boilerplate collab sheet I can find and use to achieve that? I have a dataset of only 26000 words. I already tried a silabeador library for doing it. It did half of the job for me, but it had trouble recognizing ""ąęėįųū"" letters as vowels, sometimes it's biased and what's worse, there is a 1 in a 10k chance it can randomly change one letter in a sentence like ""n"" to ""b"". All of this forces me to go through 2 million words in notepad++, which can take 3 months. This is the main reason I am looking more forward into a machine learning solution.

As in mine its own resources like oil/coal and build power plants to generate electricity for itself. Build its own computer chips and build its own datacenters to sustain its own existence then an AI can never ""take over"" humanity. That's what people forget in the AI vs humans debate. Humans are completely self-sustaining entities produced from millions of years of evolution. We can gather resources such as food, and digest food to sustain our energy needs and we can prevent extinction through sexual replication. At the current state if the humans stop managing the datacenter that houses the AI then the AI will soon die from hardware failures. And if the electricity is cut off the AI dies instantly.

young ｐｉｃｋｌｉｎｇ,"I am new to ML/DL and trying to split 2 million words from a list into syllables like string array. Is there any boilerplate collab sheet I can find and use to achieve that? I have a dataset of only 26000 words. I already tried a silabeador library for doing it. It did half of the job for me, but it had trouble recognizing ""ąęėįųū"" letters as vowels, sometimes it's biased and what's worse, there is a 1 in a 10k chance it can randomly change one letter in a sentence like ""n"" to ""b"". All of this forces me to go through 2 million words in notepad++, which can take 3 months. This is the main reason I am looking more forward into a machine learning solution. 
The input dataset looks like this:

aeronautiką

@Greylien,"Even if a general AI will come. It won't even be close to becoming a self-sufficient, self-replicating machine. When an AI can actually become self-sustaining. As in mine its own resources like oil/coal and build power plants to generate electricity for itself. Build its own computer chips and build its own datacenters to sustain its own existence then an AI can never ""take over"" humanity. That's what people forget in the AI vs humans debate. Humans are completely self-sustaining entities produced from millions of years of evolution. We can gather resources such as food, and digest food to sustain our energy needs and we can prevent extinction through sexual replication. At the current state if the humans stop managing the datacenter that houses the AI then the AI will soon die from hardware failures. And if the electricity is cut off the AI dies instantly.

@Greylien,"Even if a general AI will come. It won't even be close to becoming a self-sufficient, self-replicating machine. When an AI can actually become self-sustaining. As in mine its own resources like oil/coal and build power plants to generate electricity for itself. Build its own computer chips and build its own datacenters to sustain its own existence then an AI can never ""take over"" humanity. That's what people forget in the AI vs humans debate. Humans are completely self-sustaining entities produced from millions of years of evolution. We can gather resources such as food, and digest food to sustain our energy needs and we can prevent extinction through sexual replication. At the current state if the humans stop managing the datacenter that houses the AI then the AI will soon die from hardware failures. And if the electricity is cut off the AI dies instantly. Sometimes people are so caught up in the virtual world that they forget you can just smash a disk with a hammer.",,Modification : 4 décembre 2023 à 02:14

@Greylien,"Even if a general AI will come. It won't even be close to becoming a self-sufficient, self-replicating machine. When an AI can actually become self-sustaining. As in mine its own resources like oil/coal and build power plants to generate electricity for itself. Build its own computer chips and build its own datacenters to sustain its own existence then an AI can never ""take over"" humanity. That's what people forget in the AI vs humans debate. Humans are completely self-sustaining entities produced from millions of years of evolution. We can gather resources such as food, and digest food to sustain our energy needs and we can prevent extinction through sexual replication. At the current state if the humans stop managing the datacenter that houses the AI then the AI will soon die from hardware failures. And if the electricity is cut off the AI dies instantly.

More than anything this may be a threat as opposed to actual protest and its important to note that OAI and Google Cloud Services are unlikely to be the intended target. This is however a great test for capabilities. If you can hit Google, you can hit most people. I suspect AWS is likely panicking considering AWS Shield, edge, and a number of other security layers weren't able to deter this.

Elodine,"Okay, where to start. Is this about safety anx governance? Absolutely. Where is OAI going? Likely to stagnate and there's solid evidence to support it. So let's dive in.

Ilya Sutskever is the man behind the mutiny. If you're going 'who tf is Ilya' that's almost half the point. Dude is purposefully not trying to be in the news despite being at the center of this. Ilya was a co-founder and one of the lead scientists who created GPT. You won't find interviews with TIME supporting ethics like you would Mira Murati who originally took over in that temporary position. What you will find is the man behind most of OAI'S governance and restrictions is Ilya. That is his department.

Sam Altman has never fully aligned with OAI's public policies regarding safety and censorship. That was evident as far back as the congressional hearings and continued to be an issue during the summer where OAI heightened security regarding bad actors. Now, couple that with the GPT4 release, and the site being crippled beneath the weight, not just outside security of overloading the API with requests until DDos is achieved, but also internally with looser filters and no solutions found to prompt injection. That attack sent a shockwave through every contractor bidding for military funding that relies on OAI's tech to move their systems.

Now, pile all of that, onto Sam Altman breeding a workplace environment where the pervasive culture is 'We are building God'. If you're a safety centric nut in favor of government oversight and guiderails like Ilya, this all spells disaster.

Well, problem for Ilya because he got demoted. So he didn't have the power to actually oust Altman or Brockman. But he did have the sway with other more safety and ethics driven individuals on the board like Murati and another new player: Emmet Shear.",😱,20 novembre 2023 à 17:55
Inconnu,"Notice how, despite being the instigator, Ilya has kept as far back from the spotlight on this as possible. Going so far as to support Murati's replacement Shear. Which is equally disastrous. Murati was a former Goldman Sachs and Tesla employee with a focus on safety. But you know who Shear is?

One of the original heads of Twitch who left a few months ago. Now, on the surface, really cool aquastition. But beneath the visual fluff it's really concerning. Shear and Twitch as a whole back nearly 15 years ago are the SOUL reason the streaming market was monopolized. They paid more than their competition like own3d until these services shut down. At that point twitch hit the throttle on their advertisement payments and failed to execute the grandfathering of partnered streamers for lesser known platforms despite assurances. 

It hasn't been until now that we've seen growth again in that market thanks to YouTube and Kik. Twitch made an environment of 'aquire it all, burn what you can't' until the market stagnated. It's a sign that OAI will continue to lean into safety, fine tuning, and monetization vs actual technological breakthroughs.",,20 novembre 2023 à 17:55

More than anything this may be a threat as opposed to actual protest and its important to note that OAI and Google Cloud Services are unlikely to be the intended target. This is however a great test for capabilities. If you can hit Google, you can hit most people.

Elodine,"Okay, where to start. Is this about safety anx governance? Absolutely. Where is OAI going? Likely to stagnate and there's solid evidence to support it. So let's dive in.

Ilya Sutskever is the man behind the mutiny. If you're going 'who tf is Ilya' that's almost half the point. Dude is purposefully not trying to be in the news despite being at the center of this. Ilya was a co-founder and one of the lead scientists who created GPT. You won't find interviews with TIME supporting ethics like you would Mira Murati who originally took over in that temporary position. What you will find is the man behind most of OAI'S governance and restrictions is Ilya. That is his department.

Sam Altman has never fully aligned with OAI's public policies regarding safety and censorship. That was evident as far back as the congressional hearings and continued to be an issue during the summer where OAI heightened security regarding bad actors. Now, couple that with the GPT4 release, and the site being crippled beneath the weight, not just outside security of overloading the API with requests until DDos is achieved, but also internally with looser filters and no solutions found to prompt injection. That attack sent a shockwave through every contractor bidding for military funding that relies on OAI's tech to move their systems.

Now, pile all of that, onto Sam Altman breeding a workplace environment where the pervasive culture is 'We are building God'. If you're a safety centric nut in favor of government oversight and guiderails like Ilya, this all spells disaster.

Well, problem for Ilya because he got demoted. So he didn't have the power to actually oust Altman or Brockman. But he did have the sway with other more safety and ethics driven individuals on the board like Murati and another new player: Emmet Shear.",😱,20 novembre 2023 à 17:55
Inconnu,"Notice how, despite being the instigator, Ilya has kept as far back from the spotlight on this as possible. Going so far as to support Murati's replacement Shear. Which is equally disastrous. Murati was a former Goldman Sachs and Tesla employee with a focus on safety. But you know who Shear is?

One of the original heads of Twitch who left a few months ago. Now, on the surface, really cool aquastition. But beneath the visual fluff it's really concerning. Shear and Twitch as a whole back nearly 15 years ago are the SOUL reason the streaming market was monopolized. They paid more than their competition like own3d until these services shut down. At that point twitch hit the throttle on their advertisement payments and failed to execute the grandfathering of partnered streamers for lesser known platforms despite assurances. 

It hasn't been until now that we've seen growth again in that market thanks to YouTube and Kik. Twitch made an environment of 'aquire it all, burn what you can't' until the market stagnated. It's a sign that OAI will continue to lean into safety, fine tuning, and monetization vs actual technological breakthroughs.",,20 novembre 2023 à 17:55

He advocated for censorship only for the worst bad actors and that he genuinely didn't want to see the models bogged down by more of that.

Elodine,"Okay, where to start. Is this about safety anx governance? Absolutely. Where is OAI going? Likely to stagnate and there's solid evidence to support it. So let's dive in.

Ilya Sutskever is the man behind the mutiny. If you're going 'who tf is Ilya' that's almost half the point. Dude is purposefully not trying to be in the news despite being at the center of this. Ilya was a co-founder and one of the lead scientists who created GPT. You won't find interviews with TIME supporting ethics like you would Mira Murati who originally took over in that temporary position. What you will find is the man behind most of OAI'S governance and restrictions is Ilya. That is his department.

Sam Altman has never fully aligned with OAI's public policies regarding safety and censorship. That was evident as far back as the congressional hearings and continued to be an issue during the summer where OAI heightened security regarding bad actors. Now, couple that with the GPT4 release, and the site being crippled beneath the weight, not just outside security of overloading the API with requests until DDos is achieved, but also internally with looser filters and no solutions found to prompt injection. That attack sent a shockwave through every contractor bidding for military funding that relies on OAI's tech to move their systems.

Now, pile all of that, onto Sam Altman breeding a workplace environment where the pervasive culture is 'We are building God'. If you're a safety centric nut in favor of government oversight and guiderails like Ilya, this all spells disaster.

Well, problem for Ilya because he got demoted. So he didn't have the power to actually oust Altman or Brockman. But he did have the sway with other more safety and ethics driven individuals on the board like Murati and another new player: Emmet Shear.",😱,20 novembre 2023 à 17:55
Inconnu,"Notice how, despite being the instigator, Ilya has kept as far back from the spotlight on this as possible. Going so far as to support Murati's replacement Shear. Which is equally disastrous. Murati was a former Goldman Sachs and Tesla employee with a focus on safety. But you know who Shear is?

One of the original heads of Twitch who left a few months ago. Now, on the surface, really cool aquastition. But beneath the visual fluff it's really concerning. Shear and Twitch as a whole back nearly 15 years ago are the SOUL reason the streaming market was monopolized. They paid more than their competition like own3d until these services shut down. At that point twitch hit the throttle on their advertisement payments and failed to execute the grandfathering of partnered streamers for lesser known platforms despite assurances. 

It hasn't been until now that we've seen growth again in that market thanks to YouTube and Kik. Twitch made an environment of 'aquire it all, burn what you can't' until the market stagnated. It's a sign that OAI will continue to lean into safety, fine tuning, and monetization vs actual technological breakthroughs.",,20 novembre 2023 à 17:55

Pyropus Squantscale,"Hi, I'm a layman hard sci-fi writer looking for some advice on how to describe a decision support AI in my story. 

So there's a video game franchise called Tom Clancy's The Division, about a group of elite sleeper agents trained to restore society in the event of a collapse. They use an AI called ISAAC for a broad range of support tasks. The games themselves are typical looter-shooters, not very interesting. But the concept of a decision-making support AI for Green Beret-style nation-building operatives definitely is, which is why I'm using it in my own hard sci-fi writing. Is there a specific kind of AI that would be ideal for strategic management support for nation-building operatives? I'm looking for something that can run on a mobile ad-hoc network and provide support to a wide variety of decision-making tasks, with a special focus on resource management. I'd imagine capability with uncertain or minimal datasets would be of great use, as would interpretability ( as little ""black box"" dynamics as possible) and fault tolerance. Rules-based AI seem to lend themselves to this, but (correct me if I'm wrong) they're not very versatile and have largely become obsolete for a reason. To clarify, I'm not imagining Artificial General Intelligence here, but something that can coordinate the activities of dispersed operatives and supplement, not replace, natural human decision-making ability. Ideally, it would aggregate info and suggestions provided by human operatives into a solution that is greater than the sum of its parts (have heard of this type of tech be referred to as ""human swarming""). @ me to reply!",,15 septembre 2023 à 19:02

Pyropus Squantscale,"Hi, I'm a layman hard sci-fi writer looking for some advice on how to describe a decision support AI in my story. 

So there's a video game franchise called Tom Clancy's The Division, about a group of elite sleeper agents trained to restore society in the event of a collapse. They use an AI called ISAAC for a broad range of support tasks. The games themselves are typical looter-shooters, not very interesting. But the concept of a decision-making support AI for Green Beret-style nation-building operatives definitely is, which is why I'm using it in my own hard sci-fi writing. Is there a specific kind of AI that would be ideal for strategic management support for nation-building operatives? I'm looking for something that can run on a mobile ad-hoc network and provide support to a wide variety of decision-making tasks, with a special focus on resource management. I'd imagine capability with uncertain or minimal datasets would be of great use, as would interpretability ( as little ""black box"" dynamics as possible) and fault tolerance. Rules-based AI seem to lend themselves to this, but (correct me if I'm wrong) they're not very versatile and have largely become obsolete for a reason. To clarify, I'm not imagining Artificial General Intelligence here, but something that can coordinate the activities of dispersed operatives and supplement, not replace, natural human decision-making ability. Ideally, it would aggregate info and suggestions provided by human operatives into a solution that is greater than the sum of its parts (have heard of this type of tech be referred to as ""human swarming""). @ me to reply!",,15 septembre 2023 à 19:02

I know about the prompt, it is not really important, Just the others parameters, im using a smartphone to run it and as i said i get much more better resulta using llama.cpp with this command than using koboldcpp

@Gonçalo (G),"Ok, this helps a lot understanding your requirements. Overall, most of the information you're looking for is static, meaning, you'd be better just using the API rather than using AI to fetch it. For descriptions, LLMs can be good for summarization but can be expensive for that. In any case, answering your question, you'll need to save your data in the format that it will better answer your questions.

1 - How do I create a Docker image that contains all the tools and libraries I need for my data analysis and modeling?

2 - How do I run my Docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster and access them remotely?

3 - How do I scale up my machine learning models to handle large datasets and requests using Kubernetes?

4 - How do I monitor and troubleshoot my containers and pods on Kubernetes?

Any tips or resources would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",,12 juillet 2023 à 10:32
vascoalramos,"hi @matosmarta, I'll try to answer your questions below:
1 - You can use a dockerfile to create a docker image and include and install any packages and dependencies you migh need. You can find more information here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

2- You can have the your container images in a public register such as Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/). Then you can use the kubectl command line tool to deploy your containers using Pods (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/ and expose them with a Service (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). You can find more information here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/

3 - Could you further explain your goal and in which contexto you are trying to achieve it? @portellaa could you help with this one?
4 - In a more simplistic approach you can use the kubectl command line tool to monitor and troubleshoot your containers and pods. You can find more information here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/. Or if you need something more complex you might setup a monitoring system like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your cluster (here: https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/observability-prometheus-grafana-p1/)",🙂,12 juillet 2023 à 14:51

2 - How do I run my Docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster and access them remotely?

1 - You can use a dockerfile to create a docker image and include and install any packages and dependencies you migh need. You can find more information here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

2- You can have the your container images in a public register such as Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/). Then you can use the kubectl command line tool to deploy your containers using Pods (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/ and expose them with a Service (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). You can find more information here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/

3 - Could you further explain your goal and in which contexto you are trying to achieve it? @portellaa could you help with this one?
4 - In a more simplistic approach you can use the kubectl command line tool to monitor and troubleshoot your containers and pods. You can find more information here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/.

1 - You can use a dockerfile to create a docker image and include and install any packages and dependencies you migh need. You can find more information here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

2- You can have the your container images in a public register such as Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/). Then you can use the kubectl command line tool to deploy your containers using Pods (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/ and expose them with a Service (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). You can find more information here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/

3 - Could you further explain your goal and in which contexto you are trying to achieve it? @portellaa could you help with this one?
4 - In a more simplistic approach you can use the kubectl command line tool to monitor and troubleshoot your containers and pods. You can find more information here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/.

Regarding the bias, you need to be mindful of the fundamental importance of these variables in the ""real"" situation \ Finally hehe, Different tasks may require prioritizing specific metrics over others.
